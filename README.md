###Track AppStore Review Times
The iOS Review Time app will connect to Twitter (using your device's current Twitter account) to fetch review times. Optionally display the latest review time on your homescreen with an App Badge Icon.

Review times are fetched from developers posting on twitter with the [**#iosreviewtime**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23iosreviewtime) hashtag. This is an original idea from [shinydevelopment](http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com/). The review times given are from crowdsourced data and are not the official times given from Apple - however they're generally accurate.

###Share AppStore Review Times
Add your developer name or team name to retrieve your apps list and tweet about your app review time. Just type in your team name, and then tap on one of your apps to tweet the latest review time. Sharing your review times contributes to the reliability of the platform.

##Compatibility
Works on iOS 7.0, ARC, and 64-bit Architecture (iPhone 5S, iPad Air, and iPad Mini with Retina). Compatible with iPhone and iPad. 

Light edition for OS X shows review time in OS X status bar. Runs on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and 10.9 Mavericks. There is still a lot of work to be done on the OS X version.
