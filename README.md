###Track AppStore Review Times
iOS Review Time will connect to Twitter to fetch review times from developer posting on twitter  [#iosreviewtime](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23iosreviewtime). This is an original idea from [shinydevelopment](http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com/)

###Share AppStore Review Times
Add your developer name or team name to retrieve your apps list and tweet about your app review time.
